# IMPLEMENT A CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE ON AWS USING MYSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS).
This Repository explains the step involved in setting up client-server architecture with Mysql on AWS.

Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.
In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as "Client" and the machine responding (serving) is called "Server".

A simple diagram of Web Client-Server architecture is presented below:
